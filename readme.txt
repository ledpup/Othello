Othello is an implementation of the board-game Othello (aka Reversi). It was created in Unity with C# as the programming language. It features:

* 3D animation of plays
* Computer player (with opening book, transposition table, alpha-beta pruning negamax searching)
* Undo/redo and replay of games
* Displays archived game stats for each square
* Save/load of games
* Displays potential plays

The source code can be compiled in either Visual Studio or MonoDevelop. You will need Unity 3.5 to be able to compile and run the GUI for the game. The unity project file is stored in the Assets folder. See http://unity3d.com/.
